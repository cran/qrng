- create demo 'basket option'
- create simulation study from demo (loop over bootstrap repetitions)
- implement test functions in qrng:
  1) function(u, alpha) rowsums(u^alpha)
  2) sobold composed with Rosenblatt
  3) Kendall's tau: 4*C(u)-1
  [for comparing different construction methods of quasi copula dependent random numbers]
- implement sampling for Clayton and t copula with method = c("sobol",
  "ghalton", "none") and MO and CDM
